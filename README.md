# Wildfire Canada

Welcome to the Wildfire Canada App code repository. Wildfire Canada is an iOS application that was developed as a final year project for University of London course CM3070 - Computer Science Final Project. The aim of the project was to develop a disaster preparedness and response mobile application.
